## Description

This is a Minecraft Datapack that is compatible with version 1.21+.
It allows all players to toggle between spectator mode and survival mode. 
It is especially useful for Vanilla multiplayer server, if you don't wish to op players or have any plugins installed in order to do that.
The commands are `/trigger enterSpectate` and  `/trigger exitSpectate`.
You will return to your original position when you exit spectator mode. This is to avoid survival players to get to unintended places by abusing this.


## How to install

Download the `ToggleSpectate` folder and put it inside your world datapacks folder. You might have to do a `/reload` to load the newly installed datapack.
